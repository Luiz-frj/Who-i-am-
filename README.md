# Who-i-am-
Hello, my name is Luiz Francisco Rodrigues Junior, I'm 18 years old and I'm attending college in the area of Systems Analysis and Development (IFSP - ADS).
I was born in the city of Jahu - SP, but I'm living in Araraquara, I try to improve my knowledge in the area of programming, to specialize and be a Dev Backend for the future to specialize and be a fullstack Dev.
I will be making some of my work available here on Github and on my Linkedin ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/luiz-francisco-rodrigues-junior-a36711265/ ).
